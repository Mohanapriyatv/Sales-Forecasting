## Project Overview
This project aims to predict future sales using various regression algorithms. By analyzing historical sales data and related features, we can build models to forecast future sales and help businesses make informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data, including:
- Date of sale
- Sales amount
- Product details
- Store details
- Promotional information
- Economic indicators

The dataset is available for download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting.git
   cd sales-forecasting
   ```

2. Place the dataset in the `data` directory.

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data and train models:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```

## Modeling
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from the date, aggregating sales data, and incorporating external factors.
4. **Model Training:** Training different regression models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results
The results of the trained models, including performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the Jupyter notebook. The best-performing model can be selected based on these evaluations.
